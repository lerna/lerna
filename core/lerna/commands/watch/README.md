# `lerna watch`

> Watch for changes within packages and execute commands from the root of the repository

Install [lerna](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lerna) for access to the `lerna` CLI.

## Usage

```sh
$ lerna watch -- "<command>"
```

> ðŸ’¡ The double quotes around the command are required to prevent your shell from interpreting the inner command.

The values `$LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME` and `$LERNA_FILE_CHANGES` will be replaced with the package and the file(s) that changed, respectively. If multiple file changes are detected in one cycle, then `$LERNA_FILE_CHANGES` will list them all, separated by spaces.

> ðŸ’¡ When using `$LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME` and `$LERNA_FILE_CHANGES`, you will need to escape the dollar sign with a backslash (`\`). See the [examples](#examples) below.

### Examples

Watch all packages and echo the package name and the files that changed:

```sh
$ lerna watch -- "echo \$LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME \$LERNA_FILE_CHANGES"
```

Watch only packages "package-1", "package-3" and their dependencies:

```sh
$ lerna watch --scope "package-{1,3}" --include-dependencies -- "echo \$LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME \$LERNA_FILE_CHANGES"
```

Watch only package "package-4" and its dependencies and run the `test` script for the package that changed:

```sh
$ lerna watch --scope="package-4" --include-dependencies -- "lerna run test --scope=\$LERNA_PACKAGE_NAME"
```

## Options

`lerna watch` accepts all [filter flags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lerna/filter-options). Filter flags can be used to select specific packages to watch. See the [examples](#examples) above.

### `--verbose`

Run `lerna watch` in verbose mode, where commands are logged before execution.
