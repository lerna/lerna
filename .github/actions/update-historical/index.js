You may or may not know that lerna is now under the stewardship of Nrwl (announcement here https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/3121), a company with a long history of not just producing valuable open-source software (OSS), but also backing others (at the time of writing, Nrwl has donated over $50,000 to OSS it _hasn't_ created, see https://opencollective.com/nx for full details).

Quite simply, Nrwl ❤️  OSS, and is committed to making lerna the best it can be. We use it ourselves.

In order to take this awesome project forward from its current state, it is important that we focus our finite resources on what is most important to lerna users in 2022.

With that in mind, we have identified this issue as being potentially stale due to its age and/or lack of recent activity.
